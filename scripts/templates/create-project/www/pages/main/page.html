<h1>Welcome to %APP_NAME%, your very own MAGE game!</h1>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>Documentation and tools</h3>

For documentation and tools, you can access the MAGE dashboard here:
<a href="%APP_CLIENTHOST_EXPOSE%/app/cms">%APP_CLIENTHOST_EXPOSE%/app/cms</a>.
Once there, click on <b>Documentation</b> to get more information about how to use MAGE.

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Configuration files can be found in <b>%APP_NAME%/config</b>. We have created a default configuration
file called <b>default.yaml</b> that you and your co-workers can rely on to give you shared defaults.
You can override and extend the configuration in your personal configuration file: <b>%ENV_NODE_ENV%.yaml</b>.

<h3>About these web pages</h3>
The page you see before you have been put here to get you started. You will be replacing this
with your own HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. You can find these files in <b>%APP_NAME%/www/pages</b>.

<h2>Off to wonderland you go</h2>

Put on your wizard's hat, and have fun!
