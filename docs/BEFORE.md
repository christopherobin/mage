Before Getting Started
========================

GitHub and SSH keys
--------------------

Before getting started, make sure of the following:

* That you have been given access to the MAGE repo on GitHub.
* That you are set to use git-over-ssh

See [Set up Git@Github](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for more details
on how to get started with SSH keys for GitHub.

Getting started with Node.js?
-------------------------------

Node.js is essentially JavaScript for the server, but there are some
concepts you will most likely benefit from understanding before getting
started on a serious Node.js project.

Here are some resources which might help you make your first steps on Node.js

* [Node.js API Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Felix's Node.js Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)
