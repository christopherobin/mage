# Before starting with MAGE

## Understanding MAGE requirements

The [installation guide](./Install.md) will guide you through the necessary steps to install MAGE.
But before you go there, please make sure that the requirements described below are met.

If you are using [AerisCloud](https://github.com/Wizcorp/AerisCloud) to run your project, all the
requirements that are described here are automatically taken care of.


## Operating system

MAGE is currently only supported to run on Linux and Mac OS X.


## Node.js

Node.js (or Node) is essentially JavaScript for servers, and the MAGE platform has been built on it.
There are some concepts you will most likely benefit from understanding before getting started on a
serious Node project. Here are some resources which might help you make your first steps on Node:

* [The Node Beginner Book](http://www.nodebeginner.org)
* [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io)
* [Node API Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api)

We recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager), to be able to install multiple Node versions on your
system.

To install NVM, please follow the instructions in
[the NVM documentation](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown#installation).

To then install Node.js, please run:

```sh
nvm install 0.10
nvm use 0.10
```

## Git and GitHub

Git is a free and open source version control system that is used on MAGE. It is hosted at
GitHub.com from where you can install it. That requires you to have installed a Git client first.
Installation of Git can be done by following the instructions at the
[Git download page](http://git-scm.com/download).

To be able to install MAGE, please make sure that:

* You have created a free account on [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
* You have been given access to the [MAGE repository](https://github.com/Wizcorp/mage).
* You are set up to use [git-over-ssh](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).
