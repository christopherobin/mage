# Before starting with MAGE

## Understanding MAGE requirements

### Node.js

Node.js is essentially JavaScript for servers, and the MAGE platform has been built on it. There are
some concepts you will most likely benefit from understanding before getting started on a serious
Node project. Here are some resources which might help you make your first steps on Node:

* [Node API Documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/)
* [Felix's Node Style Guide](http://nodeguide.com/style.html)

We recommend using nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage your Node versions and environments.

### Git and GitHub

To install MAGE, you will need to have access to a git client and to [github.com](https://github.com/),
where the MAGE repository is hosted. The [installation guide](./Install.md) will guide you through
the necessary steps to install MAGE. But before you go there, please make sure that:

* You have been given access to the MAGE repository on GitHub.
* You are set up to use [git-over-ssh](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git).

### ZeroMQ (aka Ã˜MQ)

MAGE uses the ZeroMQ library to enable fast messaging between servers and processes. To allow MAGE
to build against it, the ZeroMQ library must be installed beforehand.

### Multicast DNS (aka mDNS, Bonjour, Zero-configuration networking)

MAGE uses mDNS to automatically discover other MAGE instances of the same game on the network. This
easily enables one to create a cluster of servers without much configuration. Building MAGE requires
the necessary libraries to be installed.

## Installing all requirements

If you have cURL installed on your environment, you can run the following to set up your machine.

```bash
curl http://www.wizcorp.jp/mage/environment.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually install them by following these steps.

### All environments

NVM (Node Version Manager)

```bash
curl https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh
```

The latest stable Node version compatible with MAGE.

```bash
nvm install 0.8
nvm use 0.8
```

### OS X (10.6 and up)

Please install:

* XCode (to be able to compile ZeroMQ)
* [zeromq](http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software)
* [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) (MacPorts: git-core)

mDNS is enabled by default on OS X.

### CentOS (5 and up)

Please first download the official ZeroMQ repository:

```bash
sudo curl -s "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/fengshuo:/zeromq/CentOS_CentOS-${CENTOS_VERSION}/home:fengshuo:zeromq.repo" > /etc/yum.repos.d/zeromq.repo
```

Then install:

* git-all
* avahi
* avahi-tools
* avahi-compat-libdns_sd
* avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel
* zeromq (an external repository is required)
* zeromq-devel (an external repository is required)

### Ubuntu (12.04 and up)

Please install:

* git-all
* build-essential
* avahi-utils
* avahi-daemon
* libavahi-compat-libdnssd1
* libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
* libavahi-common-data
* libavahi-common3
* libavahi-core7
* libdbus-1-3
* libzmq1
* libzmq-dev

### Debian (6 only)

Please add the following line to `/etc/apt/sources.list`:

```
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
```

Then run `apt-get update` and use `apt-get install` to install the following:

* git-all
* build-essential
* avahi-utils
* avahi-daemon
* libavahi-compat-libdnssd1
* libavahi-compat-libdnssd-dev
* libavahi-common-data
* libavahi-common3
* libavahi-core7
* libdbus-1-3
* libnss-mdns
* libzmq
* libzmq-dev

### Windows
