# Anonymous Ident Engine

The anonymous ident engine is the default identification that is used on the dashboard. It allows
you to quickly login without credentials. This can be a useful timesaver during development.

The anonymous engine cannot be configured. It's always available under the name `anonymous`. It
grants the following access level:

* `anonymous` access level in production.
* `admin` access level in development mode.
