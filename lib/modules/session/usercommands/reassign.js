// Interesting side note:
// While reassigning the session, the command response will contain the removal of the old session.
// It's the asynchronous message stream that will yield the new session object, the moment this
// callback calls setSessionKey and the message stream becomes associated with the new actor ID.
// This is normal as the new session index { actorId: toActorId } won't be sharded with the current
// user command's state.
