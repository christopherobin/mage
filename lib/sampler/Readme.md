# The sampler library

The sampler library is an interface for [Panopticon](https://www.npmjs.org/package/panopticon). It
uses configuration to handle the setup of panoptica, and exposes the methods of these panoptica as a
group. Sampler handles the sending of data to all of the panoptica, so you only need to worry about
the API.

## API

- `sampler.set(path, id, n)`, where `n`, a finite number, may replace a previous `n` for this `id`.
- `sampler.inc(path, id, n)`, where `n` is added to the previous value if `n` is a finite number.
  If `n` is not a finite number, then it defaults to `1`.
- `sampler.sample(path, id, n)`, which keeps track of the max, min, average and standard deviation
  of `n` over an interval.
- `sampler.timedSample(path, id, dt)`, which is like sample, but takes the output of a high
  resolution timer `dt` (or rather the difference between two timers).

These methods take the same arguments as a panopticon, so please see the Panopticon documentation
for more details.

## Configuration

Sampler is configured by giving it one ore more (named) intervals. For each such interval, data
will be aggregated and served on the HTTP and WebSocket Savvy routes.

Other configuration that may optionally be supplied are:

**sampleMage (boolean)**
Indicates whether MAGE itself should automatically collect its internal metrics. This provides
information on data store operations, user commands, and more.

**bufferLength (integer)**
Indicates how many aggregated results should be kept around in memory. More data means that
services querying for it can look further back into the past.

Example:

```yaml
sampler:
    sampleMage: true
    bufferLength: 100
    intervals:
        realtimeish: 1000
        bytheminute: 60000
```

## Access

The data can be accessed through the Savvy route: `/savvy/sampler`, for example by doing an
`HTTP GET` request to `http://localhost/savvy/sampler`. The same URL (with the `ws:` protocol) can
be used to create a WebSocket data stream. The "ws" module comes with a connector utility, so this
should work from your project (please do mind the hostname and port):

```sh
./node_modules/mage/node_modules/.bin/wscat --connect "ws://localhost/savvy/sampler/"
```

You can dig into the dataset by augmenting the path you query. For example, if all you care about is
the PID of the master process, you may query `http://localhost/savvy/sampler/realtimeish/data/pid/values/master/val`.

While connected through a WebSocket, you may retrieve the buffered samples by sending a message
containing the string `sendBufferedData`. This will send all deliveries, filtered through the path
you have used in the URL while connecting.
