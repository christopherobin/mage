# MySQL vault

The node-mysql module is supported through the built-in "mysql" vault type. Its configuration is:
```json
{
	"type": "mysql",
	"config": {
		"url": "mysql url as described in the node-mysql readme"
	}
}
```

This URL format is documented in the [node-mysql readme](https://npmjs.org/package/mysql).
